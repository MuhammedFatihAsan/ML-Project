    "# 📊 Week 1 Executive Summary: Target Definition & Geographic EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lead:** Member 3\n",
    "**Scope:** Target Variable Creation, Geographic Segmentation, Class Balance Analysis\n",
    "**Status:** ✅ Completed\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. 🎯 Objective & Methodology\n",
    "The primary objective of Week 1 was to prepare the dataset for the \"Value Classification\" machine learning model. This involved defining what constitutes \"good value\" and handling the complex geographic nature of the data (two distinct cities).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. 🔑 Key Findings & Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Geographic Segmentation (Task 1.16)\n",
    "* **Discovery:** The raw dataset contained two geographically distinct clusters.\n",
    "* **Action:** A hard split was applied at **Longitude -120.0**.\n",
    "    * **San Francisco:** Identified as the Western cluster.\n",
    "    * **San Diego:** Identified as the Eastern cluster.\n",
    "* **Neighborhood Analysis:** Since official neighborhood labels were inconsistent, we applied **K-Means Clustering** on coordinates to create \"Virtual Neighborhoods\":\n",
    "    * *San Francisco:* 6 Clusters (High density).\n",
    "    * *San Diego:* 8 Clusters (Spread out).\n",
    "* **Outcome:** Two new features, `city_label` and `neighborhood_id`, were added to capture location value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Target Variable Definition (Task 1.13)\n",
    "* **Metric:** A custom **\"FP Score\"** (Fair Price Score) was calculated: $$FP Score = \\frac{Price}{Review Rating}$$\n",
    "* **Classification:** Listings were categorized into 3 classes based on quantiles:\n",
    "    1.  **Excellent Value:** Top 33% (Best value for money).\n",
    "    2.  **Fair Value:** Middle 33%.\n",
    "    3.  **Poor Value:** Bottom 33% (Expensive for the rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Class Distribution Analysis (Task 1.17)\n",
    "* **Analysis:** We analyzed the distribution of the new `value_category` target variable.\n",
    "* **Result:** The dataset is **BALANCED**.\n",
    "* **Imbalance Ratio:** The ratio between majority and minority classes is **< 1.5**.\n",
    "* **Decision:** **No SMOTE or Class Weighting is required.** The model can be trained on the standard dataset without synthetic oversampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 🚀 Recommendations for Modeling (Week 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, the following strategy is recommended for the Modeling Team:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "    * **Must-Have:** `city_label` and `neighborhood_id` are critical predictors for price. Use **One-Hot Encoding** for these.\n",
    "    * **Text Features:** Incorporate NLP sentiment scores (from Member 2) as they correlate with the 'Review Rating' component of our target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Model Selection & Metrics:**\n",
    "    * Since classes are balanced, **Accuracy** is a valid baseline metric.\n",
    "    * However, monitor **F1-Macro** to ensure the model distinguishes \"Fair Value\" (the middle class) correctly, as it often overlaps with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "    * San Francisco prices have extreme outliers. Apply **Log Transformation** or use **RobustScaler** for the `price` feature before training.\n",
    "\n",

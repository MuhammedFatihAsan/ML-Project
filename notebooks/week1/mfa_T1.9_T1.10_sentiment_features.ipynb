    "2.  **T1.9 Sentiment Analysis (VADER):**\n",
    "    * We will calculate sentiment scores (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using the **NLTK VADER** tool.\n",
    "    * **Strategy:** We use the **Original (Raw) Text** (e.g., `description`) because VADER uses capitalization (\"GREAT\"), punctuation (\"!!!\"), and emojis to measure emotion intensity.\n",
    "3.  **T1.10 Text Feature Extraction:**\n",
    "    * We will calculate structural features to understand the listing quality:\n",
    "        * **Word Count:** How long is the description?\n",
    "        * **Capital Letter Ratio:** Is the host \"shouting\" in the title?\n",
    "4.  **Save:** Export the new features for the final merge."

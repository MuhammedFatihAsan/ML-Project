    "## 1. The Problem: Data Leakage in Old Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Data Leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model. In our case, we made a **critical mistake**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**OLD MODEL FEATURES INCLUDED:**\n",
    "- `reviews_per_month` - This is GUEST feedback, not landlord-controlled!\n",
    "- `review_scores_*` - These are ratings AFTER guests stay!\n",
    "- `number_of_reviews` - Accumulated over time, not available for new listings\n",
    "- Potentially `fp_score` or `value_category` derived features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This is a Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a model to predict if a student will pass an exam **BEFORE** they take it. If you include their actual exam score as a feature, your model will be 100% accurate but **completely useless** in real-world!\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, our Airbnb price-value classification model was using **review data** that only exists AFTER guests have stayed. A new listing has NO reviews, so our model couldn't predict anything for new listings!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OLD MODEL LOGIC (WRONG):\n",
    "├── Input: Listing features + Review scores + Review counts\n",
    "├── Problem: Reviews don't exist for NEW listings!\n",
    "└── Result: Model can't be used in real-world scenarios\n",

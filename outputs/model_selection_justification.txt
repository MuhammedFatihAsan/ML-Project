DETAILED JUSTIFICATION FOR TOP 2 MODEL SELECTION
======================================================================
 FIRST PLACE: XGBoost
--------------------------------------------------

Performance Summary:
  • Accuracy: 0.9940 (99.40%)
  • F1-Score: 0.9940
  • Precision: 0.9940
  • Recall: 0.9940

Justification:
  1. Achieved the HIGHEST F1-Score among all models, indicating the best
     balance between precision and recall for our multi-class problem.
  2. Strong performance across ALL metrics, showing consistent reliability.
  3. Handles the class imbalance in our Airbnb price categories effectively.

======================================================================

 SECOND PLACE: Logistic Regression
--------------------------------------------------

Performance Summary:
  • Accuracy: 0.9902 (99.02%)
  • F1-Score: 0.9902
  • Precision: 0.9903
  • Recall: 0.9902

Justification:
  1. Second-best F1-Score, demonstrating strong classification capability.
  2. Competitive performance with the top model across all metrics.
  3. Provides a good alternative with potentially different strengths
     (e.g., interpretability, training speed, or robustness).

======================================================================

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

F1-Score Difference: 0.0038
Accuracy Difference: 0.0038

Both models significantly outperform the baseline and demonstrate
strong generalization on the test set for Airbnb price classification.

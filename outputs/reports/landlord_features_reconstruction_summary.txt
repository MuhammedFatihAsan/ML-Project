## Problem Identified
Original model included review-based features (review_scores_rating, 
number_of_reviews, etc.) which are not available when a landlord first 
posts a listing. This created circular logic since these features were 
used to predict labels created from those same features.

## Solution Implemented
Rebuilt feature set to include ONLY landlord-controlled features:
- Property characteristics (beds, bedrooms, bathrooms, accommodates)
- Location (latitude, longitude, neighborhood encodings)
- Pricing (price, price_per_person) ← KEPT as essential
- Booking rules (minimum_nights, availability settings)
- Host profile (host_years, superhost status, response rates)

## Data Summary
Original dataset: 19,912 rows × 73 columns
Clean dataset: 19,912 rows × 49 columns
Features removed: 24
Features retained: 46 (for modeling)

Training samples: 15,929 (80.0%)
Test samples: 3,983 (20.0%)

## Target Distribution (Balanced)
value_category
Excellent_Value    6561
Fair_Value         6780
Poor_Value         6571

## Key Features Included
 price (essential for value prediction)
 accommodates, bedrooms, beds, bathrooms_numeric
 latitude, longitude, neighborhood encodings
 availability_365, minimum_nights
 host_years, host_is_superhost
✅room_type encodings, property_type encodings

## Features REMOVED (Review-Based)
 review_scores_* (all review score columns)
 number_of_reviews* (all review count columns)
 estimated_occupancy_l365d, estimated_revenue_l365d
 first_review, last_review, days_since_*_review

## Expected Model Performance
Previous accuracy with reviews: ~99% (circular logic)
Expected accuracy without reviews: ~65-75% (realistic)

The lower accuracy is CORRECT because:
1. We're predicting future value without knowing future reviews
2. The model must learn from property features alone
3. This matches real-world use case (new listing prediction)

## Next Steps
1. Retrain all models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, MLP)
2. Compare performance with landlord-only features
3. Add NLP features from listing descriptions (optional enhancement)
4. Evaluate realistic model performance

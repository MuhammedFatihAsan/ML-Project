DATA PREPROCESSING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (LANDLORD PERSPECTIVE)
================================================================================

ORIGINAL DATA:
  - San Francisco: 7,780 listings
  - San Diego: 13,162 listings
  - Combined: 20,942 listings, 80 columns

AFTER CLEANING:
  - Final dataset: 19,912 listings, 58 columns
  - Features preserved: 58

TARGET VARIABLE:
  - Name: value_category
  - Classes: Poor_Value, Fair_Value, Excellent_Value
  - Based on: Landlord-controlled features ONLY (NO REVIEWS)
  - Quality indicators: accommodates, beds, bathrooms, superhost, instant_bookable
  - Distribution:
value_category
Fair_Value         6780
Poor_Value         6571
Excellent_Value    6561

KEY STEPS PERFORMED:
   Removed irrelevant columns (URLs, IDs, text descriptions)
   REMOVED ALL REVIEW-BASED FEATURES (data leakage prevention)
   Converted data types (price, percentages, booleans, dates)
   Feature engineering (host_years, price_per_person, etc.) - LANDLORD ONLY
   Handled missing values (preserved important landlord features)
   Removed outliers (price outliers using IQR method)
   Encoded categorical variables (partial - low cardinality only)
   Created target variable (FP Score - LANDLORD PERSPECTIVE)
   Train-test split deferred to T1.6 (after all feature engineering)

OUTPUT FILES:
  - data/processed/listings_cleaned_with_target.csv
  - data/processed/feature_names_T1.2.txt

VISUALIZATIONS:

  - outputs/figures/price_distribution_cleaned.png
  - outputs/figures/value_category_distribution.png

CRITICAL NOTES:
   NO REVIEW DATA USED - Pure landlord perspective
   All review-based features excluded to prevent data leakage
   Target based on features available at listing creation time
   neighbourhood_cleansed and property_type preserved for T1.4
   Train-test split will be performed in T1.6

NEXT STEP:
  Task 1.3: Algebraic Feature Engineering
